# Password Reset Security Features

## Overview
This document describes the security features implemented for the password reset functionality in the Restaurant Reviews application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Password History Prevention
- **Location**: `controllers/userController.js` - `resetPassword` function
- **Functionality**: Prevents users from reusing any of their previous 5 passwords
- **Implementation**: 
  - Stores password history in the User model
  - Uses bcrypt.compare() to check new password against all previous passwords
  - Maintains a rolling history of the last 5 passwords
- **Error Message**: "New password cannot be the same as any of your previous passwords. Please choose a different password."

### 2. Enhanced Password Complexity Validation
- **Server-side**: Enforces password requirements during password reset
- **Client-side**: Provides real-time validation feedback
- **Requirements**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one number (0-9)
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*...)

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- **Password Requirements Display**: Shows clear requirements before password entry
- **Real-time Validation**: Client-side checks provide immediate feedback
- **Consistent Messaging**: Server and client validation use the same requirements
- **Password History Limit**: Clearly indicates that previous 5 passwords cannot be reused

## Security Flow

1. **Username Verification**: User enters username on forgot password page
2. **Security Question**: User answers their security question
3. **Password Entry**: User enters new password with requirements displayed
4. **Validation Checks**:
   - Password complexity requirements
   - Password confirmation match
   - Current password re-use prevention
   - Password history re-use prevention (last 5 passwords)
5. **Password Update**: If all checks pass, password is hashed and stored

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `controllers/userController.js`: Added password history checking and complexity validation
- `database/models/User.js`: Added passwordHistory and passwordHistoryLimit fields
- `migratePasswordHistory.js`: Migration script for existing users

### Frontend Changes
- `views/resetPassword.hbs`: Added password requirements display (including history limit) and enhanced client-side validation

## Testing the Feature

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter a valid username
4. Answer the security question correctly
5. Try to enter the same password as the current one
6. Verify that the system rejects the password with an appropriate error message
7. Try entering a password that was used previously (if you've changed passwords before)
8. Verify that the system rejects previously used passwords
9. Try entering a password that doesn't meet complexity requirements
10. Verify that the system provides clear feedback about missing requirements

## Security Benefits

- **Prevents Password Re-use**: Users cannot reuse their current password or any of their previous 5 passwords
- **Enforces Strong Passwords**: Ensures all reset passwords meet security standards
- **Password History Tracking**: Maintains a secure history of previous passwords
- **User Education**: Clear requirements help users create better passwords
- **Consistent Security**: Same validation rules apply to registration and password reset
- **Rolling History**: Automatically manages password history to prevent database bloat
